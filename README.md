Microsoft movie analysis project.
In this project, we are tasked with giving recommendations to Microsoft as they decide to join the movie industry.

We start by preparing our virtual learning environment.
I prioritized movie ratings and voter viewership as the number of people who watch a movie directly affects sales.
I loaded the data to the environment
I merged to data sets title.basics and title.ratings as they had a common column tconst
I removed all duplicates from the data set and only kept one copy of each duplicate
I dropped all empty titles 
I processed the data to return data with year, genre, votes, and average rating to better visualize the data and use it to give recommendations.


Based on the data I used the best-performing movies are Action, adventure, and SciFi with an average rating of 8 over one decade.

Recommendation, based on the data I used it is very clear that Action movies are a fan favorite. It is my recommendation that Microsft gets the best producers for action movies and has a high focus on that genre.
